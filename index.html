   <P style="width:50%">Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. From the
coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then
roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles
that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.</P>
